You will see a message saying "Patch successful" when it is done.
 
The patching process will create a new file called "Inazuma Eleven 3 - Sekai heno Chousen ! The Ogre (FR) (Traduit en FranÃ§ais) (DS).nds" in the same folder. This is the patched ROM that you can play on your DS or emulator with French subtitles.
